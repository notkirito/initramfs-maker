# initramfs-maker
A script that makes an initramfs, based on the files you give it

NOTE: I am working on this. It might take a while.

## Dependencies:
WIP, but definitely bash and probably awk.



## Usage:
(WIP)
Make the file like the configfile template.



## Installing
(WIP)
Copy `mkinitramfs.sh` somewhere writable by you.
